# AmatriceRoughFault


This repository contains files needed to prepare setup for dynamic models of the 2016 Amatrice earthquake model using SeisSol (https://github.com/SeisSol/SeisSol) 
presented in 'Broadband dynamic rupture modeling with fractal fault roughness, frictional heterogeneity, viscoelasticity and topography: the 2016 Mw 6.2 Amatrice, Italy earthquake' by Taufiqurrahman et. al. (in prep).
